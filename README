ADWAITA TWEAKED

    Rather than maintaining the full Adwaita Gnome Shell and GTK3 css code base
    to modify the themes, this repo holds a small set of overrides that are
    more easily maintained between Gnome point releases.

    The end goal is to create a modular approach to overriding the stock theme
    by including css module files that contain very specific override rules.
